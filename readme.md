Iron Man Arc Reactor Mark VI (Canvas Edition)

This project is a high-fidelity, interactive digital recreation of Tony Stark's Mark VI Arc Reactor, featuring the "New Element" pure white core. It integrates a live AI interface with FRIDAY, Stark's second-generation AI, utilizing voice synthesis and advanced LLM reasoning.

Key Features

Interactive 3D Perspective: The reactor housing reacts to mouse movement, creating a dynamic parallax depth effect.

FRIDAY Voice Integration: Full verbal communication using the Aoede (Irish) voice profile. FRIDAY doesn't just display text; she speaks directly to you.

Dynamic HUD: Real-time status monitoring for core stability and energy output.

Overdrive Mode: Clicking the reactor core initiates a high-energy discharge state with custom visual effects and unique AI dialogue.

Neural Logging: A live terminal that tracks your conversation history and system alerts.

How to Use

Initialization: Click the "ACCESS CORE" startup screen to boot the system and initialize FRIDAY's neural link.

Verbal Query: Type your questions or commands into the input field on the bottom right and press Enter. FRIDAY will process your request and respond verbally.

Overdrive: Click on the physical Arc Reactor graphic or the "Manual Overdrive" button to toggle maximum power output.

Navigation: Move your cursor across the screen to inspect the internal components of the reactor assembly.

Technical Specifications

UI Framework: Tailwind CSS for a responsive, glassmorphism interface.

Graphics: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) with CSS filter-based "Ultra-Bloom" and pure white core gradients.

AI Core: Powered by Gemini 2.5 Flash for natural, witty, and contextual Irish personality mapping.

TTS Engine: Low-latency PCM-to-WAV conversion for high-quality voice synthesis.

Security Note

Access is restricted to Stark Industries personnel. Ensure your secure link is active before attempting to bypass safety protocols.
